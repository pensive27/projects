Please explain your choices of research interests - what motivates and interests you about these areas? (400 words) 

Before undertaking my MSc in microbiology at Nottingham University, my sole interest had been in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance. Other research areas I sought after needed to fit both these categories. However, after undertaking my dissertation project in synthetic biology, I discovered a whole new avenue to explore in the microbiological field. Even though I had no prior experience in the field, I found the process of literature research and learning the methodologies fascinating, because I enjoy learning. I was interested in how both fields could combat infection and enhance microbiology research. Since undertaking my novel project, I  remained mindful to explore different avenues within the life science field, particularly cross-disciplinary projects.  In fact, my work experience supports evidence of such notion and such mentally would continue upon undertaking a research project. 

Recent advances within my chosen research interests also fuelled my interest:  new antibiotics have been discovered using advanced AI and molecular biology techniques, even synthetic biology has helped to understand how bacteriophage aid human urinary cells in clearing bacterial infection.  There have even been research investigating how probiotic bacteria may be used as a skin lotion to help repel infection. With all these interesting advances within the molecular microbiology field, I could not turn down the opportunity to take part in this growing field of research. 

Finally, my my my employments show interest within these fields as I have worked as a microbiologist and molecular biologist. This involved in some cases analysis of results or undertaking projects. Working within these areas further strengthened my decision to pursue these research interests, because I honestly enjoyed the work I did. I can use the skills I learnt from these professions to further aid my PhD project additionally, if I had little interest within these fields, I would not have pursued such career pathways. 

What experience and technical skills do you already have that prepare you for pursuing a PhD in the areas you have identified? (400 words) 

I have multi-disciplinary experience within the research, clinical and industrial sectors. I have experience communicating with non- scientific departments, such as engineers making me an efficient communicator and project organizer. Below are the most relevant skills to this PhD application.

My MSc project involved transforming non-pathogenic Escherichia.coli to maintain a recombinant plasmid that could detect acyl homoserine lactones from Pseudomonas aeurignosa. The project allowed me to develop fundamental molecular biology skills in cloning, electroporation, PCR and basic microbiology such as plating. I also showed initiative in helping to plan out aspects of the project, such as DNA sequencing and PCR. 

Currently, I work as a technician at the University of Bedfordshire. The job involves preparing laboratory classes for the leading academic. The process could involves attending meetings to helping with protocols, preparing the solutions, buffers, reagents or growing cells/microorganisms. There is a lot of time management, project management and aiding students with undertaking how to perform laboratory techniques. I feel this job as already prepared me for working within a university as a PhD student because I know the planning, preparation and knowledge needed to prepare university-based projects. 

 I have also worked as a technician at The Technology Trade Partnership. The role focused on a device that could extract, amplify and detect certain SNP markers in human DNA by quality control testing primers and probes used to detect them. This included routine qPCR, DNA extraction, isolation and storage. The project tested the sensitivity of these probes using different parameters to ascertain conditions within the device, such as detection, temperature and ethanol tolerance.  Furthermore, I tested different DNA saliva extraction devices to find the most efficient one, this was further supplemented with work involving questionnaires to find the most user-friendly device for the public to use. Lastly, I was involved in optimizing DNA yield from these silica-based membrane devices. 

I also worked as a technical officer in a collaborative effort with the engineering department at the University of Hertfordshire. The project involved testing a prototype Bacillus atrophaeus endospore disruptor. I was responsible for managing lab work including autoclaving, stock checking, planning and analysis. Work involved real-time PCR, dipicolinic assay, viable counting and protein quantification. As one of the main microbiologists, it was my job to explain the results and techniques used to the engineers so that progression could occur. 

Why have you applied to the Nottingham DTP in particular? (250 words)* 

I applied for this DTP because the programme offers individual and group-based learning in research fields I find interesting. The pre-arrival audit makes the programme tailor-made to inspire me with confidence that the training will engage and meet my own needs. Giving me the skills necessary to not feel left behind. This is further augmented by further training after the induction period that shows the programme is well adjusted to meet the needs of each candidate.  

The two laboratory rotations come across as providing me the flexibility to explore my chosen research interests, or even explore others. I like the proposal of having a trial of my project helping me make an informed decision. I also like the refinement project, allow me the freedom to adjust the project as I will feel part of the team and excited to implement my own ideas. 

The annual conference and placements are an opportunity for me to network and consider what I wish to do after my PhD. It is also a chance for me to explore different avenues related to my degree. I look forward to socialising with the rest of the PhD participants during this the event and learning about the different projects being undertaken. I also welcome the opportunity for me to broaden my experiences through a range of industries and environments through placements. 

What are the main challenges for you personally in undertaking a PhD? How will you overcome these challenges? (250 words)* 

 The main challenges for me are related to my time as an MSc student and previous projects through employment. Below is an example:

My MSc project was partly challenging and presented the first technical difficulties beyond the level expected as a student. This included: contamination, failed experiments and difficulty with focusing on the project over time due to perceived failure. Evidently this lead to emotional and mental stress as the project seemed to spiral towards failure. 

My approach was to find alternative solutions by asking those with more experience on the subject or performing further research.  During this time, I also developed troubleshooting skills and learnt to plan for contingencies which could slow down a project. For example: where electroporation failed, I explored other transformation techniques such as heat shock. With contamination, I prepared new stock and cleaned equipment. When unknown results started appearing, I pursued whether it hindered the project’s advanced and if it could be ignored. 

To regain focus  I maintained diligence on the main objective, rather than losing sight in what couldn’t be rectified. Overtime, I  discovered that reaching the main objective is not where growth and self-discovery occurs. It is through the journey which an individual goes through, coupled with how they react to challenging situations, that define how they deal with problems. I did complete my project with results to discuss, but I learnt much more on how goals should be challenging and the journey, not destination is important.

What are the things that excite you about undertaking a PhD? (250 words)* 

While undertaking my role as a technician at a university I quickly realized how I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. Additionally, I constantly reminisced about my days at university whilst helping the students and seeing them attain achievements. I have always known since finishing my first degree that I wanted to pursue a PhD. The prospect of rejoining the academic environment as a student and being about to progress my learning and scientific skills repertoire is enthralling. 

I look forward to being mentored on becoming an efficient research scientist as my career aspirations line up with this prospect.  I also appreciate how PhD seeks answers to unknown questions; I have already had a taste of this through previous projects and I look forward to undertaking my own research challenge. It excites me to be able to call a project my own and forward my own input to construct interesting avenues to tackle any issues that arise. The whole reason I chose a science career was to become a research scientist and a PhD is the culmination within my academic ventures that guide me to where I want to be. 

Finally, I look forward to meeting like-minded people and the ability to socialise with them in topics we find interesting and to explore new avenues of interest. 

Describe three personal attributes you possess which you feel will make you a successful PhD student. (250 words)* 

I am resilient: I have given an example already of my tenacious attitude towards work. If there are problems with my PhD project, I will not create excuses. I would seek aid both independently and co-dependently to unearth what can be done. 

I am a team worker: I have already mentioned how I worked in several interdisciplinary jobs and how I had liaised with several different departments. Being a scientist to me is about teamwork. Many researchers from around the world could collaborate to complete a project.  I know how to communicate and present friendly mannerisms. Working with me as a student will prove this.

Knowledge: I have the intelligence to undertake the work in my field in both theoretical and practical sense, otherwise I would not have made it far within my field. I also have the sense to understand when I do not know something and seek to learn in order to progress with my work.
